Fring is a reddit theme that anyone can use for their subreddit or use as their reddit theme.

Change your subreddit theme in two easy steps, 1. Upload the spritesheet image to your stylesheet. 2. Copy the CSS from fring-stylesheet.css and paste it into the the stylesheet page on reddit. 

If you want to customize your theme for your subreddit go to http://www.reddit.com/r/Fring/wiki/customize and follow the instructions for each different addon. I'm always updating the theme, so make sure you are subscribed to /r/Fring so that you don't miss any important updates. 

If you have any questions about the theme or you just need help implementing it, PM me on reddit http://www.reddit.com/user/imjustadude90
